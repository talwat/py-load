## Info

Py-load is a simple python package that allows you to very easily add loading bars to your CLI app.

Py-load is very lightweight, and requires no other dependencies, and is also fairly customizable.

It uses modern python features to make the code organized and maintainable.

This whole repository is some what of a learning project. So I may goof up every now and then, since I am not very experienced with Github and all of its features.

That's why you may see some strange commits every now and then. Sorry!

*Note: I will do my best to keep the **code** itself clean and organized*

## Requirements

Py-load only needs [Python](https://python.org) 3.0 or higher, as it uses Python 3 features.

**Tested Python Versions**
* 3.10
* 3.9
* 3.8

## Installing

### Installing from source

Download `py_load.py` and put it in your projects source folder, and then your done!

This will give you the newest features, but it may be unstable.

### Installing with Pip

You can also use pip to install it by doing `pip install py-load-lib`

This will usually be fairly stable and robust, however it is updated quite slowly.

## Usage

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/talwat/py-load/wiki) for info on usage.
