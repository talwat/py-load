# PY-LOAD

## Info

Py-load is a simple python package that allows you to very easily add loading bars to your CLI app.

It uses modern python features to make the code organized and maintainable.

## Requirements

Py-load only needs [Python](https://python.org) 3.0 or higher.

*(Note: Only tested with python 3.9 and 3.10, should work on older versions)*

## Installing

Download `py_load.py` and put it in your projects source folder, and then your done!

pip may also be an option in the future, however for now you have to download the python file manually.

## Usage

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for info.

In the future documentation will be found in Github's Wiki feature.
