# PY-LOAD

**A super simple, easy to use module for python.**

## Info

Py-load is a simple python package that allows you to very easily add loading bars to your CLI app.

Py-load is very lightweight, and requires no other dependencies, and is also fairly customizable.

It uses modern python features to make the code organized and maintainable.

## Requirements

Py-load only needs [Python](https://python.org) 3.0 or higher, as it uses Python 3 features.

*(Note: Only tested with python 3.9 and 3.10, should work on older versions)*

## Installing

### Installing from source

Download `py_load.py` and put it in your projects source folder, and then your done!

This will give you the newest features, but it may be unstable.

### Installing with Pip

You can also use pip to install it by doing `pip install py-load-lib`

This will usually be fairly stable and robust, however it is updated quite slowly.

## Usage

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/talwat/py-load/wiki) for info on usage.
